ggitTITLE: Battleship

VERSION NUMBER: 1.2

DESCRIPTION: This project is focused on using TDD to create a battleship game. The goal is to create a working game without using any visual methods ( such as using console.log() or DOM methods ), and only once the game is working to create the UI

PROJECT STATUS: In Progress

TO DO:
- add special CSS styling for both hit board pieces, and ship pieces
- create a module that is shown when the game is over that displays the winner
- create a module used to get the player's name and initializes the game when submitted, so it can be used in the game
- update tests
- create mocks for tests
- build UI

TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML, CSS, JS, Webpack, NPM, Jest

WHAT I'VE LEARNED:
- how to write tests to see if a unit of code works as expected
