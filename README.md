TITLE: Battleship

VERSION NUMBER: 1.5

DESCRIPTION: This project is focused on using TDD to create a battleship game. The goal is to create a working game without using any visual methods ( such as using console.log() or DOM methods ), and only once the game is working to create the UI

PROJECT STATUS: In Progress

INSTRUCTIONS: To stop the test file from throwing an error when executing the tests you will need to make sure that the ES6 modules in the modules directory are commented out, and that the exports using module.exports, and imports using require are not commented out; to make the code run the ES6 modules have to be uncommented, and the exports using module.exports, and imports using require need to be commented out.

TO DO:
- add special CSS styling for both hit board pieces, and ship pieces
- build UI

TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML, CSS, JS, Webpack, NPM, Jest

WHAT I'VE LEARNED:
- how to write tests to see if a unit of code works as expected
