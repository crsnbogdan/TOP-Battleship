TITLE: Battleship

VERSION NUMBER: 1.0.

DESCRIPTION: This project is focused on using TDD to create a battleship game. The goal is to create a working game without using any visual methods ( such as using console.log() or DOM methods ), and only once the game is working to create the UI

PROJECT STATUS: In Progress

TO DO:
- update tests
- create mocks for tests
- create UI
- add event listeners to the gameboard pieces that trigger the receiveAttack() method
- implement a way of displaying when the game is over
- create a module used to get the player's name and initializes the game when submitted, so it can be used in the game

TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML, CSS, JS, Webpackk, NPM, Jest
